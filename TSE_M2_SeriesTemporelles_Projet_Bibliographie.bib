	abstract = {The goal of this paper is to describe a forecasting model for the hourly electricity load in the area covered by an electric utility located in the southeast of Brazil. A different model is constructed for each hour of the day. Each model is based on a decomposition of the daily series of each hour in two components. The first component is purely deterministic and is related to trends, seasonality, and the special days effect. The second is stochastic, and follows a linear autoregressive model. Nonlinear alternatives are also considered in the second step. The multi-step forecasting performance of the proposed methodology is compared with that of a benchmark model, and the results indicate that our proposal is useful for electricity load forecasting in tropical environments.},

	volume = {16},
	abstract = {We address a problem faced by every supplier of electricity, i.e. forecasting the short-term electricity consumption. The introduction of new techniques has often been justified by invoking the nonlinearity of the problem. Our focus is directed to the question of deciding whether the problem is indeed nonlinear. First, we introduce a nonlinear measure of statistical dependence. Second, we analyse the linear and the nonlinear autocorrelation functions of the Czech electric consumption. Third, we compare the predictions of nonlinear models (artificial neural networks) with linear models (of the ARMA type). The correlational analysis suggests that forecasting the short-term evolution of the Czech electric load is primarily a linear problem. This is confirmed by the comparison of the predictions. In the light of this case study, the conditions under which neural networks could be superior to linear models are discussed.},

	abstract = {The sensitivity of electricity consumption to air temperature and air humidity are effective indicators in evaluating the impacts of countermeasures against urban heat islands. The impacts of these countermeasures vary in time and space and so sensitivities based on finer resolution data are needed. Using actual hourly electric power consumption data from the business districts of Tokyo, we calculated the sensitivity of electric power consumption using multiple regression analysis. The sensitivities appear from 07:00 to 23:00 local standard time (LST) during weekdays during both winter and summer, mainly from 09:00 to 17:00 LST. The sensitivities to air temperature during winter are approximately 0.7–1.1 (W/floor-m2)/°C on an average and those during summer are approximately 1.1–1.4 on an average; the sensitivities to air humidity are approximately 0.6–0.9 on an average. It was found that the sensitivities to air temperature are caused due to heating during winter and cooling during summer; further, the sensitivities to air humidity were caused by dehumidification not for conditioning the air humidity of the room but for the condensation around the air-conditioner's coils with cooling during summer.},

	title = {Analyzing the impact of weather variables on monthly electricity demand},
	volume = {20},
	doi = {10.1109/TPWRS.2005.857397},
	abstract = {The electricity industry is significantly affected by weather conditions both in terms of the operation of the network infrastructure and electricity consumption. Following privatization and deregulation, the electricity industry in the U.K. has become fragmented and central planning has largely disappeared. In order to maximize profits, the margin of supply has decreased and the network is being run closer to capacity in certain areas. Careful planning is required to manage future electricity demand within the framework of this leaner electricity network. There is evidence that the climate in the U.K. is changing with a possible 3/spl deg/C average annual temperature increase by 2080. This paper investigates the impact of weather variables on monthly electricity demand in England and Wales. A multiple regression model is developed to forecast monthly electricity demand based on weather variables, gross domestic product, and population growth. The average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the worst model is approximately 2.60\% in fitting the monthly electricity demand from 1989 to 1995 and approximately 2.69\% in the forecasting over the period 1996 to 2003. This error may reflect the nonlinear dependence of demand on temperature at the hot and cold temperature extremes; however, the inclusion of degree days, enthalpy latent days, and relative humidity in the model improves the demand forecast during the summer months.},
